# RandomNrGenerator_LA1200
This is my first programming project in C#. It isn't anything very complicated. In this short program the computer generates a random number.
The goal is to guess the random number that was generated and to guess how many attempts you will need to do so. 
The computer will give hints, like if your guess is higher or lower than the random number. 

Take a look if you're interested and feedback is welcome. Please keep in mind, I am a beginner.
